The `master` branch contains an example without import. It compiles and works in the browser by manually providing the BonsaiJS lib, but fails on `run-js` and `test-js`.
The `with_imports` branch contains the same example but with an import for `Rect`. The IDE does complain about it and it doesn't compile.
